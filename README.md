# Demo.Api

Develop a RESTful API that would allow a web or mobile front-end to:
• Create a contact record
• Retrieve a contact record
• Update a contact record
• Delete a contact record
• Search for a record by email or phone number
• Retrieve all records from the same state or city
The contact record should represent the following information: name, company, profile
image, email, birthdate, phone number (work, personal), and address.
